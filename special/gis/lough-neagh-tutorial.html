            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <h2>Lough Neagh</h2>
                <p>Lough Neagh is the largest freshwater lake in the British and Irish Isles, located in Northern Ireland. It covers an area of about 151 square miles (392 square kilometers).
                Some of the biggest towns around Lough Neagh include Antrim, Cookstown, and Magherafelt.
                Culturally, Lough Neagh holds significance in Northern Ireland for several reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Historical Significance:</i> It has played a role in the region's history, serving as a transportation route, a source of livelihood for fishermen, and a focal point for various activities over the centuries.</li>
                    <li><i>Economic Importance:</i> Lough Neagh is a vital resource for the local economy, particularly through its fishing industry, which produces eels and other freshwater fish.</li>
                    <li><i>Tourism and Recreation:</i> The lake's scenic beauty attracts tourists and outdoor enthusiasts, offering opportunities for boating, birdwatching, and hiking along its shores.</li>
                    <li><i>Cultural Symbolism:</i> Lough Neagh is often featured in Northern Irish folklore and literature, contributing to its cultural symbolism and identity within the region.</li>
                    <li><i>Environmental Conservation:</i> Efforts to protect and preserve the lake's ecosystem also hold cultural significance, as they reflect the local commitment to environmental sustainability and heritage.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Overall, Lough Neagh is an integral part of Northern Ireland's landscape, history, and culture, playing various roles in the lives of its residents and visitors.</p>
            <h2>Problems in the Lough (Algal Bloom), 2023</h2>    
            <p> Lough Neagh is currently facing a severe environmental challenge characterized by the proliferation of toxic blue-green algal blooms.
                These blooms are primarily driven by the presence of excess nutrients, specifically nitrogen and phosphorus, in the lake's waters. These nutrients enter the lake through agricultural runoff, where fertilizers from nearby fields are carried into the water system.
                The growth of these harmful algae species is further exacerbated by the presence of invasive Zebra mussels, which have increased water clarity by filtering suspended particles.
                This clearer water allows more sunlight to penetrate to greater depths, stimulating algal photosynthesis and providing ideal conditions for algal blooms.
                Climate change also plays a role in this issue, as rising temperatures in the region have contributed to the algal proliferation. Over the last two decades, Lough Neagh has experienced an increase in water temperature by approximately 1°C.
                The consequences of these toxic algal blooms are far-reaching.
                They pose a direct threat to wildlife and have been linked to the deaths of birds and dogs. 
                Furthermore, anglers are advised against consuming fish caught in these waters due to potential contamination. 
                The blooms have also led to the temporary closure of several water-based businesses operating on Lough Neagh.
                Efforts to address this environmental crisis are impeded by the lack of a dedicated environment minister in the government of Northern Ireland, where the environment portfolio is currently included within the agriculture department. 
                This lack of dedicated oversight hampers the ability to respond effectively to the issue.
                In response to these challenges, there is a growing call for urgent action, including the formation of a multi-departmental emergency response plan, increased resources, and comprehensive efforts to reduce nutrient runoff into the lake.
                Scientific research and collaboration among stakeholders are essential in developing both short-term and long-term solutions to restore the ecological balance of Lough Neagh and safeguard it for future generations.

            <h2>LIDAR</h2> 
            <p>
                LIDAR technology involves using laser pulses to create highly detailed topographic maps of the lake and its surroundings. 
                These maps can be instrumental in understanding and mitigating the environmental crisis in Lough Neagh.
                Utilizing LIDAR maps offers several advantages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Accurate and high-resolution elevation data.</li>
                    <li>Identification of potential sources of nutrient runoff.</li>
                    <li>Improved understanding of water flow patterns and sediment transport.</li>
                    <li>Facilitation of targeted environmental restoration efforts.</li>
                    <li>LIDAR maps over time confirms changes in the shoreline and lakefloor over time.</li>
                </ul>
